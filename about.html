        Matthew Gonzalez is a passionate artist who, while young, has an incredible drive for his own art.
        He enjoys making art based on Nintendo video games which include Pikmin, Mario, and Pokemon.
        While his art might seem very rough, he has went through a tough journey of discipline and is completely self taught!
        This page is dedicated to him in order to inspire him to keep making art and realize that, while it might not
        seem like it, he's being seen. His art is something that always manages to brighten up my familys day, and
        I couldn't be more proud of him.

    <h1>Final Notes</h1>
    <p>
        Now some might ask why I would choose to make a website representing someone elses work rather than my own.<br>
        While it would make sense, I figured that since my brother is more of an artist than I am he would have more<br>
        interesting work to show off. This website has helped me polish my skills and get used to making websites<br>
        in a timely manner.
