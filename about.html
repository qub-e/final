        Matthew Gonzalez is a passionate artist who, while young, has an incredible drive for his own art. 
        He enjoys making art based on Nintendo video games, including Pikmin, Mario, and Pokemon. 
        While his art might seem very rough, he has gone through a challenging journey of discipline 
        and is completely self-taught! This page is dedicated to him in order to inspire him to keep 
        making art and realize that, while it might not seem like it, he's being seen. His art 
        always manages to brighten up my family's day, and I couldn't be more proud of him.

    <h1>Final Notes</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of this website is to be a showcase for my brother's work. In
      the future, he will edit this website to add stuff himself. I plan on maintaining 
      the code while also teaching and showing him some web development resources when he 
      is ready. The skills that this website has taught me is how to make layouts to fit
      sketches that I've made. In addition,I have also learned the importance of time management. 
      Time management is hard, especially when you get big ideas for a website that should be more 
      limited and realistic in scope. I hope to be able to do more stylistic things in the future 
      once I learn javascript.
