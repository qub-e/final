    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Matthew Gonzalez is a passionate artist who, while young, has an incredible drive for his own art.<br>
        He enjoys making art based on Nintendo video games which include Pikmin, Mario, and Pokemon.<br>
        While his art might seem very rough, he has went through a tough journey of discipline and is completely self taught!<br>
        I couldn't be more proud of my own brother and hope he keeps pursuing his passion.
